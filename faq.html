    <h3>Who can participate in NeNa?</h3>

    <p>If you are a PhD student at the GTC, you can receive 1 CT for active participation and 0.5 CT for passive participation in NeNa.</p>

    <h2>Type of Participation</h2>

    <h3>What counts as active participation?</h3>

    <h3>Can I choose whether I present a talk or poster?</h3>
    <p>You can indicate your preference on the abstract submission form, and we will do our best to accommodate all wishes. However, we cannot guarantee it, as talk slots are limited. We will let you know in a timely manner before the conference if you have been assigned a talk or poster.</p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>

    <p>We will take a bus together on Wednesday from Tübingen Hbf, early in the morning (we will update the time later) please be there about 15 min before.</p>

    <h3>Do I have to stay overnight at the conference location or can I organize my own accommodation?</h3>
    <p>Participants are strongly encouraged to stay at the conference location, as NeNa includes not only a scientific program but also social activities. However, you are free to organize your own accommodation and/or transportation. Please indicate in the registration form. Note that you will still have to pay the full registration fee.</p>

    <h3>I don’t live in Tübingen and will have to travel here on the day before the conference and/or travel back on the day after the conference. Do you help with accommodation?</h3>
    <p>Yes, please indicate so on the registration form, and we will do our best to find local conference participants who can host external guests. If you prefer to organize your own accommodation in Tübingen, you are of course welcome to do so.</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <h3>When is the abstract submission deadline?</h3>
    <p>The (updated) deadline to submit your abstract (for a talk, poster, or workshop) is September 17th.</p>

    <h3>Is there a word limit for the abstract?</h3>
    <p>Yes, your abstract can be max. 300 words long.</p>

    <h3>How long should my talk be and what should it be about?</h3>
    <p>Your talk should be approximately 15 min + 5 min questions. Your results do not need to be final; presenting preliminary results or thought-out and structured proposals is completely fine.</p>

    <h3>What size should my poster be?</h3>
    <p>Posters should be A0 (84.1 x 118.9 cm), portrait orientation. If you want to bring a landscape poster, please let us know before the conference!</p>

    <h2>Others</h2>

    <h3>What is the Introduction-Blitz-Karaoke?</h3>
    <p>In order to make getting to know your fellow conference participants easier, we would like to introduce everyone very briefly at the beginning of the conference. To facilitate the introductions, we will ask you shortly before the conference via email to send us one presentation slide about yourself, stating:
      <ul>
        <li>Your name (incl. pronunciation)</li>
        <li>Pronounce</li>
        <li>Where you are from</li>
        <li>Where you work</li>
        <li>Any interesting facts/hobbies</li>
      </ul>
    Feel free to do this in a creative way!<br>The slide should be in pdf format and named <code>&lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;.pdf</code>. On the first day, we will then play Introduction-Blitz-Karaoke. You will be randomly assigned another person’s slide and must introduce them based on its contents.</p>
