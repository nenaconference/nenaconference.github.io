    <p><strong>GTC Alumni:</strong> Alumni are eligible for a travel grant to cover transportation costs but must still pay the registration fee of 50€. This fee is non-refundable.</p>
    <p>Any student that cancels their registration after the final registration deadline and whose spot cannot be replaced with a wait-listed applicant will still have to pay the full registration fee.</p>

    <h3>What is included in the registration fee?</h3>
    <p>The registration fee includes transportation, two nights of accommodation at the Youth Hostel, and food (breakfast, lunch, and dinner if indicated before).</p>

    <h3>If I cancel my registration, will the registration fee be refunded?</h3>
    <p>If you cancel your registration before the final registration deadline, your registration fee will be refunded.</p>
    <p>Any student that cancels their registration after the final registration deadline and whose spot cannot be replaced with a wait-listed applicant will still have to pay the full registration fee.</p>
    <p>If you do not show up at the bus or the venue on the first day of the conference, the registration fee will be charged to cover transportation and accommodation costs.</p>

    <h3>When and where does the transportation to the conference site leave and arrive?</h3>
    <p>We will take a bus together on Wednesday from Tübingen Hbf, Bay R, early in the morning (we will update the time later) please be there about 15 min before. Please bear in mind the bus does not have a toilet and the ride lasts a little over 2h30.</p>

    <h3>Do I have to stay overnight at the conference location or can I organize my own accommodation?</h3>
    <p>Participants are strongly encouraged to stay at the conference location, as NeNa includes not only a scientific program but also social activities. However, if you also organize your own transportation, you are free to organize your own accommodation. Please note that you will still have to pay the full registration fee.</p>

    <h3>I don’t live in Tübingen and will have to travel here on the day before the conference and/or travel back on the day after the conference. Do you provide accommodation?</h3>
    <p>Yes, please indicate so on the registration form, and we will do our best to find local conference participants who can host external guests. If you prefer to organize your own accommodation in Tübingen, you are of course welcome to do so.</p>

    <h3>Is there a word limit for the abstract?</h3>
    <p>Yes, your abstract can be max. 300 words long.</p>

    <h3>How long should my talk be and what should it be about?</h3>
    <p>Your talk should be approximately 15 min + 5 min questions. Your results do not need to be final; presenting preliminary results or thought-out and structured proposals is completely fine.</p>

    <h3>What size should my poster be?</h3>
    <p>Posters should be A0 (84.1 x 118.9 cm), portrait orientation. We can accommodate a few landscape posters, but if you want to bring a landscape poster, please let us know before the conference!</p>

    <h3>What is the Introduction-Blitz-Karaoke?</h3>
    <p>In order to make getting to know your fellow conference participants easier, we would like to introduce everyone very briefly at the beginning of the conference. To facilitate the introductions, we will ask you shortly before the conference via email to send us one presentation slide about yourself, stating where you are from, where you work, any interesting facts/hobbies, etc. Feel free to do this in a creative way! The slide should be in pdf format and named &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;. On the first day, we will then play Introduction-Blitz-Karaoke. You will be randomly assigned another person’s slide and must introduce them based on its contents.</p>
